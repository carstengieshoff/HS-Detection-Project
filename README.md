# HS-Detection-Project
This is our code for the project for the course ANLP at Maastricht University

by  Zhaolin Li, David Pomerenke, Carsten Gieshoff

This project is based on 'Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language' by Davidson et al. from 2018. (https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14955)

We also used their code from https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language.


# This is a description about the structure of the code for duplication.

Multilingual:
	- Multilingual_Hate_Speech.ipynb
	- validation.csv: source data
	- BERT_XXXXX.bin: pretrained BERTweet model
	# The rest are generated by running the ipynb file.
	- translated.csv: after MBART translation
	- alldata_2label.csv: set both hate and offensive as toxic
	- alldata_2label.csv: seperate hate and offensive and remove offensive later

Hate speech:
    - FeatureFunctions.py: simplified and accumulated version of original code for easy use in down stream tasks.
    - ReplicationWithTrainTestSplit.ipynb: Replication of model from orig. paper with train-test-split
    - ComparingTokenizations.ipynb: Notebook to analysze influence of tokenization on Logistic Regression model
    - AggresiveWeighting.ipynb: Notebook to analysze influence of aggressive weighting on Logistic Regression model
    - BertClassification.ipynb: Notebook with Implementation of BERT classifier
    - TweetBertClassification.ipynb: Notebook with Implementation of BERTweet classifier
    - ml_model_comparison.ipynb: code for the comparison in section 5.2
